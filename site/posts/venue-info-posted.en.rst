We've gathered some info about `accommodation and transportation`_,
including how to get to the venue from the airport, where to get a SIM card (at the airport!),
and where to stay. All the mentioned places are in a list of `Google placemarks`_.

There are plenty of options, from 350 baht (just over US$10) to one luxury hotel at around 7000 baht (more than US$200).
At least 10 hostels are within 10 minutes walking from the venue, with both dorms and private rooms.

The venue is directly on the BTS (Skytrain) line, so it's also possible to stay closer to the city center.
We have some placemarks for Siam and Sathorn as well. 

There are also plans for some exciting social events that we'll announce as soon as everything is finalised.

Looking forward to see everyone!
