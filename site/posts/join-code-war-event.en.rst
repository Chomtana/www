We have enough teams competing but not enough audience on friday 6:30-10pm!

Please join us for some light entertainment and free pizza and non-alcoholic drinks. Code War a light hearted event many enjoyed at BKK/Hack last year and each PyCon Australia conference.

Come along to watch, or bring your laptop to play along with the teams on stage. Or join the qualification round and see if you are faster than you think?

Correction to the rules: you will be allowed internet.
