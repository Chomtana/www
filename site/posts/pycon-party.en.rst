After the last talk on Saturday there’s no time to waste |mdash| come to the
official PyCon Thailand Party!

We’ll have free pizza and drinks (first drink free |mdash| soft drink, water,
local Thai beer, or local Thai rum!) about 7:30pm.  Afterwards we have 3 great
electronica-style live performances lined up for you including the infamous
`Kijjaz`_ who is one of the most sought-after keyboardists playing for all the
top pro acts but has a private passion for programming music with
microcontrollers and will be creating a special performance just for us.
Headlining is `DCNXTR`_ which is Thailand’s best electronica act |mdash| both
innovative and quite danceable at the same time |mdash| hard to find that
combo and you’ve experienced nothing like their music. Opening is `Orbital XX`_,
one of Bangkok’s best up and coming electronica acts to kick it all off.

Sure to be something for everyone to enjoy and the venue has plenty of places
to hangout and talk more quietly across its four floors of space if you prefer
that. Come check out Silom, a great part of Bangkok and get the best sampling of
Thailand’s indie music scene that you’re ever likely to find.
