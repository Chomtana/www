All our extended early bird tickets are gone again, less than 5 days after extension. Thank you for your support!
You can still grab your tickets at 1,600 baht for subsidized tickets and 3,000 baht for regular tickets. And all students out there: you can get your student tickets at 600 baht only! But we do have limited tickets too.

For those who need to submit tax claims, please note that invoices will be issued for regular tickets only.
