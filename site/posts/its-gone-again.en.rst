All our extended early bird tickets are gone again in less than 5 days after extension. Thank you for your support!
You can still grab your tickets at 1,600 baht for subsidized tickets and 3,000 baht for regular tickets. And all students out there. You can get your student ticket price at 600 baht only! But we do have limited tickets too.

For those who wants tax claims, please note that invoice will be issued for regular tickets only.
