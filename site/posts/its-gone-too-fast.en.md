Our early bird tickets were sold out in less than one week!

Thank you for your support! As a token of appreciation, we’re extending one last round of early bird tickets for those who just got to know about the event. 
So last chance for you to grab your early bird tickets! And yes, it is really very limited.
If you can afford it, we encourage you to purchase a regular ticket as it enables others who can't afford a regular ticket to attend. 

You'll be helping us build a Python community event that is accessible to more people.
If your company is paying for you, please note that you can only get a tax invoice with the regular ticket.

Buy your tickets via Ticket Melon now!
