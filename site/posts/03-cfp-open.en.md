After the great success to our very first PyCon Thailand, we’re inviting you to submit your proposal for the 2nd edition of PyCon Thailand happening on June 15-16 2019 in the all new True Digital Park. 

PyCon’s happening all over the world so join us and be a part of this dynamic community. The PyCon Thailand will be a two day weekend conference conducted in both Thai and English.

Submission is open to anyone with any level of expertise. Whether you’ve started Python yesterday or since 20 years ago, every experience is different. Whether you live in Thailand, Southeast Asia or anywhere around the world, we welcome you! We want to put on the most interesting conference we can and we can do that with your help.

Start preparing now and send us your proposal!
