official PyCon Thailand Party!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll have free pizza and drinks (first drink free — soft drink, water,
local Thai beer, or local Thai rum!) about 7:30pm.  Afterwards we have 3 great
electronica-style live performances lined up for you including the infamous
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://th.pycon.org/en/party#kijjaz"&gt;Kijjaz&lt;/a&gt; who is one of the most sought-after keyboardists playing for all the
top pro acts but has a private passion for programming music with
microcontrollers and will be creating a special performance just for us.
Headlining is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://th.pycon.org/en/party#dcnxtr"&gt;DCNXTR&lt;/a&gt; which is Thailand’s best electronica act — both
innovative and quite danceable at the same time — hard to find that
combo and you’ve experienced nothing like their music. Opening is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://th.pycon.org/en/party#orbital-xx"&gt;Orbital XX&lt;/a&gt;,
one of Bangkok’s best up and coming electronica acts to kick it all off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure to be something for everyone to enjoy and the venue has plenty of places
to hangout and talk more quietly across its four floors of space if you prefer
that. Come check out Silom, a great part of Bangkok and get the best sampling of
Thailand’s indie music scene that you’re ever likely to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full Details and how to get there on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://th.pycon.org/party"&gt;PyCon Official Party&lt;/a&gt; page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://th.pycon.org/en/posts/pycon-party/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2018 13:41:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Tickets sold out!</title><link>https://th.pycon.org/en/posts/tickets-sold-out/</link><dc:creator>PyCon Thailand team</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;We're all sold out!

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session Chair&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session chair will be responsible for organizing tasks in the session room. The tasks include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce the speaker. Keep it simple. Only name, where they're from and talk title.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the clock and notify the speaker for Q&amp;amp;A session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help the speaker disconnect everything as they leave the stage (microphone, laptop) and
make any last announcements (next talk, break, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session Runner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session runner will be responsible for preparing the speaker for the session. The tasks are as follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the speaker and make sure they're in the speaker lounge 15 mins before the talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get them ready by checking their laptop and other equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brief the speaker on what to expect onstage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the speaker into the session room and help them set up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hand off to the session chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People at the registration desk will be responsible for welcoming the attendees, registering them
and handing out the souvenir. This role is shift-based, so it is possible to choose between morning, afternoon or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested please register &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/forms/DY1vCXJPBAmvukfg1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
We're looking forward to work with you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://th.pycon.org/en/posts/volunteer-recruitment/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 27 May 2018 11:04:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Try our Monty Python Quiz.</title><link>https://th.pycon.org/en/posts/preliminary-quizth/</link><dc:creator>PyCon Thailand team</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The schedule contains references to &lt;em&gt;Monty Python&lt;/em&gt;, from whence the name &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; came.

There may still be a few changes, so subscribe to our website to be notified when the schedule is changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to buy your ticket!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://th.pycon.org/en/posts/schedule-publishedth/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 13:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Venue info posted</title><link>https://th.pycon.org/en/posts/venue-info-posted/</link><dc:creator>PyCon Thailand team</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've gathered some info about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://th.pycon.org/en/venue"&gt;accommodation and transportation&lt;/a&gt;,
including how to get to the venue from the airport, where to get a SIM card (at the airport!),
and where to stay. All the mentioned places are in a list of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/maps/placelists/list/10AVZ09RRblPyf72xyLPatQghauY?hl=en"&gt;Google placemarks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of options, from 350 baht (just over US$10) to one luxury hotel at around 7000 baht (more than US$200).
At least 10 hostels are within 10 minutes walking from the venue, with both dorms and private rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue is directly on the BTS (Skytrain) line, so it's also possible to stay closer to the city center.
We have some placemarks for Siam and Sathorn as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also plans for some exciting social events that we'll announce as soon as everything is finalised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to see everyone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://th.pycon.org/en/posts/venue-info-posted/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 13:41:09 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
