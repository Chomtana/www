<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Python may be one of the simplest and most flexible programming languages out there, but it is still a programming language. It still has syntax, datatypes, and some occasional dark corners. Python "warts" are things for which people have criticised Python, typically aspects of the language or mechanisms of its implementation, because such aspects either expose certain surprising inconsistencies, are regarded as omissions, or cause irritation for parts of the community in some sense.</p>
<p>This talk will be about common pitfalls (termed warts/landmines) that people face using Python programming language.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<p>The only pre-requisite is that you must have some basic familiarity with Python programming language. Although it'll be good that you have laptops with Python already setup, it's not required as such !</p>
<p>If you are really curious how this talk will go, you can watch a similar talk for Ruby and Javascript at the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">destroyallsoftware</a> site.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>"DL is only for the big techs" might be true previously. Now, with new knowledge like Transfer Learning, open-sourced pre-trained models, and free GPUs like at Google Colab, is it now time for individual ML enthusiasts to enter and build some meaningful ML app? Let's explore together in this talk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id10">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A couple years ago, Machine Learning was thought of as the subject requiring intensive computing power and comprehensive understanding of mathematics. Thus, public assumed that it was the job exclusively for giant tech companies with super-genius researchers.</p>
<p>Today, the community has achieved substantial advancements and they are open enough to share their achievements and computing resources to the public at no expenses. Frameworks like TenserFlow, Keras make building a Deep Learning model require only a Python code snippet. Furthermore, Transfer Learning helps developing models even easier by taking portions of pre-trained more generic models, many of which are open-sourced. This has potentials to accelerate the machine learning apps on mobile devices, one of the emerging trend in the field, where compactness and performance are preferred over accuracy.</p>
<p>With rich on-line resources around, including online courses (many of which are free), blog posts, and computing resources available at no expenses, the talk covers the steps to apply those knowledge to build a small, yet useful app based on Deep Learning model - without Deep Pockets, a Ph.D., and mega infrastructure.</p>
<p>The talk is intended for beginners with background in traditional software developments. Mathematical knowledge in differential calculus (derivatives - not in the context of Stock Futures) is useful but not required as it may be touched briefly. Audiences are not expected to walk away as subject matter experts after finishing the talk but the speaker hope to spark inspiration to learn more on the subject and eventually end up developing something for their own use.</p>

<p>Earned a B.Eng. nearly 20 years ago, when the vocabularies like "Deep Learning" and "Data Science" had not even been materialized. His full time job is traditional software development (Python is not used) and it has no direct relevance to Machine Learning.</p>
<p>He discovered MOOCs in late 2013 and completed his first MOOC on Coursera in 2014. Since then, he has completed over 60 courses (he tries to increase the number even though has already lost the exact count) including a number of Python programming and Machine Learning courses.</p>
<p>In his spare time, apart from doing MOOCs/writing Python programs and practicing Keras/TensorFlow framework, he also writes Swfit programs (and published one on iOS AppStore, although, again, Swift is not used in his full time job) He also does endurance sports like long distance running (a.k.a. marathons), triathlons, and high-altitude trekking</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Due to the proliferation and continuously improvement of solar PV, energy storage, electric vehicles, Internet of things (IoT) devices, these open up new opportunities and change the ways how end-use customers (smart homes and smart buildings) engage in the electricity market. Rather than passively consume energy by purchasing electricity with a fixed tariff from an electric utility, in the near future they can become prosumers who are able to generate revenue on their excess energy and able to obtain transparently-source, reliable energy. This talk discusses the development of a Multi-Agent System Platform, so called PEA HiVE, with Blockchain Energy Trading application.  Python is selected to be the development language for the IoT integration and backend, whereas Hyperledger and React Native are chosen to be the Blockchain development platform and our mobile frontend respectively.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Basic biological, ecological, and population demographic information is essential to species conservation and management. The identification of individuals  within  a  population  allows  the  study  of  growth  rates,  age  structure,  sex  ratios,  survivorship,  residency,    distribution,    movement    patterns,    and    population size, which are important for ecological and behavioral studies. The automatic identification could enhance performance of this process. In this talk, algorithm and the way of using python and OpenCV to assist users for identification using facial photograph is addressed. The experimental result could show the performance and promising of the idea.</p>

<p>Some web-developers work on the backend and some on the frontend but after all, it comes down to the usability and bug-free delivery of the updates and new releases of functions to the customers. To test frontend directly while writing reusable test cases using Robotframework is another question.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This talk is a short talk about how a simple Gherkin-styled Python based Robotframework could be used to write test cases. It covers the brief installation using python envwrapper - an environment isolation package and simply showing 2 python scripts which is usable with Robotframework and 1~2 Robotframework's keyword-based testing. It will also cover some important inbuilt functions in Robotframeworks such as sending out keystrokes to the System and using some other libraries to help and make front-end testing a much more awesome experience. Another part of the talk would be describing a single keyword base and some yaml scripts to make the test-cases more reusable.</p>

By the time I left them, we have successfully migrated the system into Microservices architecture. This talk will walk you through multiple points of time during that period. Explaining how we gradually pull functionalities out of the legacy system. What kind of challenges have we faced along the way. What have we learned so far.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>"Ad Tech" is the use of digital technologies by vendors, brands,  and their agencies to target potential clients. One popular case is mining the Web to identify their logos.  I will show you how to do this by using PyTorch - a popular deep learning framework in Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id42">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>In this talk. We will walk through the one significant use of deep learning for digital marketing and ad tech, the image recognition, which brands use to identify their potential clients, deliver personalized offerings and analyze the spending in the world of social media. The easiest way to identify the brand is by its logo.</p>
<p>The logo detection can be done by object detection models.  We will use PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework in Python, to build the model to identify a brand by its logo in an image.  Along the talk, we'll see the relative value of deep learning architectures-Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) , learn the effect of data size, augment the data when we don't have much, and use the transfer learning technique to improve the model.</p>

<h2>Python + XPath = Extra Parsing Power</h2>

<div class="section" id="id45">
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Python offers powerful string and nested data tools. One can parse HTML/XML with only built-ins or light wrappers. While such approaches are appealing there are benefits to borrowing more from the XML world. We discuss XPath and XML DOMs and show how well integrated approaches yield cleaner code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id46">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Python's power in manipulating strings and handling nested data structures is well known. So much so that for many mild XML and HTML processing use cases one can get the job done using only built-ins and common parts of the standard library.  But the markup language world offers many powerful tools which do not map so directly onto python's data model.  And there are large gains to be had if we use native XML tools alongside python and give each component the chance to shine when it can.  At the same time learning new tools takes time and adding new parsing and query engines to a project consumes resources.  The aim of this talk is to highlight those situations where the benefits of calling in heavy machinery from the XML world outweigh the costs.</p>
<p>We begin with an overview of the XPath query language and use example queries to highlight differences between python's nested data model and that of common markup languages.  For example HTML distinguishes between attributes and content while a nested collection of python dicts, list and tuples only has content.  To be sure we can express the same information in both models.  But we can write shorter, clearer and more-efficient-to-process queries when we retain the distinction.  Similarly we can traverse python's built-in data structures with combinations of various braces and parentheses but it is not so simple to pass references into such nested structures and then navigate around.  With an XPath processor and common document object model such actions are straightforward – and arguably more pythonic than a solution built entirely on native language features.</p>
<p>Finally we connect things back together with some simple web-scraping examples.  Here we use XPath queries to quickly extract elements of interest and then leverage python's string handling capabilities to swiftly convert that content into native data types.</p>
<p>Examples will employ both the lxml parsing library and the selenium web scraping framework.  The goal is to focus on use cases where the XML machinery is worth employing.  All the wrappers are similar and we wish to highlight that it does not particularly matter which package you learn – it matters that you learn when to employ XPath and a proper DOM.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>I think we began to use Python in some production systems at 2.3 or 2.4. I think Python 2.4 had enough functionality to build any system. Many tools ware created and used.</p>
<p>Python 2.4 was released nearly 15 years ago. Since then Python has been steadily evolving.
Although it is possible to create a system with only Python 2.4, it is necessary to know the latest Python trends in order to write code that is better, more maintainable, and more performance-oriented.</p>
<p>There are also features and grammar in the web knockout that are often overlooked, not only by new python users, but also by seasoned Python veterans.
I will introduce those features and grammar that I think are important while comparing the grammar and functions incorporated in Python 2.4 and now.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>I'll give a visually interesting talk on Jupyter, to show how:
- exploratory programming is a powerful tool that should be in every Python developer's arsenal,
- it's great for beginners to learn Python,

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>By Jupyter! I'm gonna show you the power of Jupyter!</p>
<p>By that I mean I'm going to do a live demo of Jupyter notebooks.</p>
<p>When I was a kid I grew up with the BBC Model B. When you switched this thing on, you got a prompt. You could launch into BASIC and write programs. Suddenly you felt powerful. The possibilities were endless. 30 years later, Jupyter again gives me that same feeling of being able to explore, solve problems, and that awesome power was right there at your fingertips.</p>
<p>The exciting thing about this talk is that people will be able to interact with it as I go, and even write some code.</p>
<p>I'll explain what Jupyter is, what it's used for, and then I'll do a demo using Jupyter to mess around with some data and make some plots. Then wow the crowd with an animation.</p>
<p>I'll set up a sandboxed notebook that the audience can access, such that they can follow along and try out the code on their mobile phones or laptops. For Android users, I'll then show them what they need to do to install jupyter running under termux, a debian-like environment for Android (no rooting required). Then I'll show them the awesome power of being able to write Python on a mobile device, by writing a script to log my phone's location and take photos, and show them by SSHing into a jupyter session on my phone and walking around with it.</p>
<p>Live demos galore!! What can possibly go wrong?? But the nice thing is, because the jupyter notebooks will be running locally, I don't have to depend on the internet.</p>
<p>My hope is that this talk will inspire people that programming is fun and exciting, and to remove the barrier to entry of it being hard to set up an environment.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Yannix has been providing Visual Effects (VFX) preparation and support services for over 2 decades. Located in suburban Bangkok, Yannix currently has about 350 employees.  We work on the latest Hollywood blockbuster movies,  many of which have won or been nominated for Academy Awards in VFX.  Examples of movies we have worked on recently include Black Panther, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Thor: Ragnarok. We develop completely custom, proprietary software packages for the computer graphics and image processing work we do, which includes match moving services such as 3D camera tracking (input: video, output: how the camera moved in 3D per frame), rotoscoping (output: cut-out of characters/objects per frame),  VR 360 motion reconstruction and image stitching, and many more.  For the past 12 years, we have been using Python as our primary application programming language, with specific code optimization for computationally intensive inner loops optimised into C++ library calls or small GPU programs.  We start our talk by showing a sizzle reel of the VFX-prep work we have done for our Hollywood movie clients.  We will then talk about the many cool things that can be done using Python by showing how we have used it.  We hope that by sharing this information, you will gain some insight into how Python can be used to effectively run your business, especially if, like Yannix, you need heavy compute power for algorithms requiring  parallel processing, data mining, machine learning, or computer vision.</p>
<p>We have used Python in many cool ways. We will briefly present several cases here.  As part of our earlier tracking application, we have an application called Ptrack which not only is written primarily in Python, also uses Python scripting as a file format for application data storage.  Our current flagship application Obsidian (which is also written primarily in Python) uses Python as a macro language where all  UI widgets write out the corresponding Python API calls to a scripting window so that users can add their own Python macros to buttons by a simple cut/paste.  Obsidian is a GUI-based software developed in Python with parts such as image processing, multidimensional minimization and real-time interactive display functionality optimized in C++ or CUDA and called via Python.  Among its functions are feature matching and 2D motion analysis, 3D camera tracking, rigid object tracking, and rotoscoping services.  While we extensively use C++ as our inner loop optimization for parts of the code with high computational complexity, we also take full advantage of multiprocessing in the computational intensive sections.  Python is intentionally weak at high performance multiprocessing, but we will present how one can easily make Python applications that are truly multiprocessing by spawning threads in Python that call C++ functions which release the global interpreter lock, or simply using OpenMP from C++ functions.  Our C++ function calls are sometimes SIMD optimized to get up to about 4 times speedup for many of our image processing routines.</p>
<p>We have also created advanced technologies such as automatic feature matching using  Bayesian classifiers that learn from data mining previously processed images.  Along the same lines, we have studied the creation of strong classifiers from a number of weak ones through the AdaBoost classifier we use via the open source scikit-learn library, a machine learning Python library. Nearly all aspects of our business operations are modeled through OpenERP (now called Odoo), also completely scripted in Python.  We will show the various unique features we have added to OpenERP to localize it for Thailand and to add our own innovative modules for workflow management, task/project management, company policy management, budget management, and many more.  We will also introduce a preview of the Yannix ERP (YnxERP) system currently under development to replace our OpenERP system by the end of 2018.  Even the distributed datastore/database used for the YnxERP was completely developed inhouse and has many innovative features we can share.  We will also introduce how we used Python scripting to integrate our software with Autodesk Maya, a popular 3D animation and modeling software commonly used in the VFX industry. Additionally, we will also present how we have successfully implemented GPU-based programming for image processing and other algorithms requiring massively parallel architectures, and called it from Python applications.  Having seen the many ways we have used Python in our business, we hope you will find something from this talk that will be of value to you and your business.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The sequence of nucleotides in a DNA can be represented as a one-dimensional array.  A necessary task in genomic data science is finding all subsequences in a DNA sequence that match an input string. As the sequence to be searched is extremely long, finding the most efficient solution is a priority.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>I became immersed in the template-matching problem after I encountered it while studying genomic data science. However, this application area will only be mentioned briefly, as the template-matching problem is also relevant to other application areas. The main focus of my talk is how the multi-dimensional array-handling ability of NumPy (not found in the core Python) provided an efficient solution to the problem of template-matching. Finally, I consider alternative solutions and compare them with that of NumPy.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>You can do so much with a single Python function:
from answering web requests to building chatbots.
And we can do that completely  without maintaining a server,
using Functions-as-a-Service!
Let's look at the pros and cons—hint: billing is special!—and
look at a chatbot built with an AWS Lambda.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id64">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Just a Python function.
That's all we usually need to answer web requests,
to process uploaded images or to have our chatbot reply to chat messages.
To run a Python function, you don't want to create and maintain a server.
Instead, you want FaaS: Functions-as-a-Service!</p>
<p>In my talk, I'll explain the idea and power of FaaS.
We'll also consider potential challenges and limitations to be aware of.
Persisting data and pricing are obvious ones,
but you likely might want to organize your code differently, too,
if you want to build an entire app on FaaS
and think about versioning, too.
Finally, I'll demo how to answer an HTTP request with a AWS Lambda function,
for example to build a chatbot or answer a SMS.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Writing functional-style Python can be challenging ranging from minor nuisance such as verbose lambda syntax to more serious problems such as iterator chaining and pattern matching. Coconut is a functional superset of Python that aims to enable elegant and Pythonic functional-style code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id88">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>With functions being first-class citizens, Python allows us to build programmes with higher-order functions. However, it is often cumbersome to do something that would be bread-and-butter in a typical functional language. The lack of concise syntax for lambdas, currying and function compositions is a nuisance. The lack of boilerplate-less pattern matching and pattern matching could be a deal breaker. This talk presents Coconut, a functional superset of Python, which aims to enable writing elegant functional code, whilst staying with the familiar Python environment and libraries. We will identify various pain points of writing functional code in Python, and demonstrates how Coconut addresses the problems. In particular, we will start with a basic coding problem, and move on to designing a machine-learning pipeline with a functional approach.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>Can self-tracking and personal data help us become more productive, healthier, and happier?</strong></p>
<p>It’s easier than ever to track our lives, work and bodies with a smartphone, wearable, home sensor or computer. But what can we do with all this data? Can it help you become a better version of yourself?</p>
<p>While we often hear about data in terms of data leaks and surveillance, personal data and self-tracking can be empowering too.  With smartphones, wearables, tracking apps, home sensors, and many other methods, it’s easier than ever to collect a lot of data on our lives. But we are still struggling to engage and find meaning in all of the data we collect.</p>
<p>Python and its data science toolset can help transform personal data into a personal dashboard of data visualizations and predictive models. How can python help us better collect, visualize, understand and find patterns in our personal data and self-tracking?</p>
<p>In this talk, I’ll show you how to track your life in different ways, and, with python’s data science toolkit, how to engage and understand that data. The stated goal of the quantified self and self-tracking is to “measure or document something about your self such that it gains meaning.” I think we can go one step further and use data to become better; use data to become data-driven!</p>
<p>In the first part of this talk, we will introduce what is self-tracking and the quantified self as well as various methods that can be used to track and collect data on our lives using wearables, smart phones, apps, computers, sensors, professional testing, etc. We will use python to collect, clean up, process and combine the data together. In the second part, our objective is to create a comprehensive dashboard of our life in data. We will begin our exploration of our personal data by creating a series of data visualizations. In the last part, we will use some statistical and machine learning techniques to search for categories, patterns, relationships and predictions in all of our tracking data.</p>
<p>By the end of the talk, you should be equipped with some ways to track your life, health, productivity and more as well as how to use Python’s data science tools to engage, visualize, find patterns, and make predictions with your data.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Data scientists increasingly encounter problems whereby data objects exhibit network-like inter-connectivity. Graph-theoretic computation enables feature extraction from relationship graphs. This talk shows how easy it is to leverage readily available Python libraries/functions to perform such tasks</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Much of 'Big Data' revolution has to do with dealing with non-traditional datatypes and feeding machine learning engines with non-numerical variables. Just as Convolutional Neural Networks excel at object recognition task precisely because the convolution layers expressly capture grid-array information embedded in the 2-dimensional visual field, analysis involving network-patterned objects (individuals in an online social network, transportation nodes, banking accounts with payment network, etc.) stands to benefit from the ability to extract graph-theoretic properties from the network connectivity patterns, either to provide insights in and of themselves, or as pre-processing to further machine learning task down the line.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Asynchronous networking may seem hard to understand at first, in this talk I will show this is not the case.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>If you want to write an efficient server, asynchronous networking is an excellent strategy to do so. To build a production ready system, you would use asyncio, tornado, twisted, trio or another popular implementation. However, to fully understand how and why it works, I will ignore these solutions and instead craft an artisanal asynchronous implementation in front of your very eyes. Step by step we will turn a blocking socket server, only capable of handling a single connection at a time, into a beautiful non blocking server that has no trouble dealing with many connections at once. By the end, you should see that asynchronous code is not magical at all, but nevertheless incredibly useful.</p>

<h3>Elastic / Jongmin Kim - Developer Advocate / Evangelist</h3>
<p>Founded in 2012 in Amsterdam by the people behind Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene, Elastic set forth a vision that search can solve a plethora of data problems. The origins of the company start back in 2010, when Shay Banon wrote the first lines of Elasticsearch and open sourced it as a distributed search engine. With the rise of cloud computing and changes in IT infrastructure demanding requirements such as real-time search across infinite amounts of structured and unstructured data, Shay foresaw the need for a new type of software to solve today's real-world data problems. Steven Schuurman, Uri Boness, and Simon Willnauer shared in Shay's vision, joining forces to create the Elastic company we have today. Since then, the creators of Kibana, Logstash, and Beats have joined the Elastic family, rounding out a product portfolio known as the Elastic Stack, which is used by millions of developers around the world. The Elastic family unites employees across 32 countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p>
