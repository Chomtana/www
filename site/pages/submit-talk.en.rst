It is a pleasure to invite you to PyCon Thailand!

PyCon_ is a network of non-commercial conferences, hosted by Python programming communities all over the world. This year, the Thai Python community is organizing the first PyCon in Bangkok, with local and international participation.

The conference is organized by a group of Python afficionados and will take place in Bangkok at `Knowledge Exchange for Innovation`_. We hope this will increase the visibility of Python in Thailand.

We know the schedule is a bit tight, so we'll make sure we answer you as quickly as possible.
Because of the time constraints, all talks will be accepted based on the abstract only. 
In no way does that imply that your presentation should be any less awesome than your abstract.
