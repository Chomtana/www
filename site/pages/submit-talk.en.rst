We know the schedule is a bit tight, so we'll make sure we answer you as quickly as possible.
Because of the time constraints, all talks will be accepted based on the abstract only.
In no way does that imply that your presentation should be any less awesome than your abstract.

For more information, please look consult the `Call for paper`_

Who Should Submit a Proposal?
-----------------------------
You. Your friends. Your friends’ friends. Anyone with any level of Python knowledge is a candidate for a great
topic at this conference. We want talks in Thai and English. We want who live in Thailand, Southeast Asia and
from around the world. We want to put on the most interesting conference we can and we do that with your help.

Whether you got started with Python last month or you’ve been around for 20 years, we think you’ve got something to

Training day for first-time speakers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to welcome first-time speakers and improve their conference experience, we'll be having a training day one day before the conference!
This will allow new speakers to do a run-through to get used to the venue, and to gather some final feedback.

.. To register interest for the training day, please submit your email address here:

Speaker Benefits
----------------
PyCon_ has a strong tradition of being a conference of peers and as such, everyone pays, even speakers.

What Talk Types Are Needed?
---------------------------

Conference Talks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the most important talk type! We are aiming at a two track conference, but the venue could support even a three
track conference! Your talk should be either 30 minutes or 45 minutes and leave some room for questions at the end.

Lightning Talks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lightning talks are a great PyCon_ tradition. They are 5 minutes only talks (we do count down).
This would be a great opportunity for first-time speakers to step up and give a short talk about a useful Python
library they recently discovered or about interesting Python events that will happen in the near future.

Workshops
~~~~~~~~~
If want to do a more in depth tutorial or training as part of this conference send us your proposal. Workshops
are free for attendees so paid workshops are not appropriate this year. Workshops are between 1-3 hours.
We will work the schedule around including workshops if we feel its valuable.

Proposal Selection Process
--------------------------

Selecting the proposals to include in the conference is complex, involving a selection committee, and several meetings.
We take the process very seriously, and respect and value the effort that every submitter has taken in preparing their
proposal. We will be annoucing the date of the talk schedule and who as been accepted at a later date.
