  Siam Commercial Bank was established by royal charter on January 30, 
  1907 as the first Thai bank. During its more than 110 years in business, 
the Bank has played a leading role in providing the financial services needed in Thailand, 
developing deep expertise.
Under the vision to serve as "The Most Admired Bank,‚Äù SCB has established a strategic plan called SCB Transformation, 
designed to dramatically upgrade the Bank's infrastructure and enhance its long-term competitiveness. 
This transformative plan responds to rapid change in the financial services industry, 
which is being reshaped by digital technology, regulatory change and new consumer behavior. 
Following this strategic plan's "Going Upside Down" approach, the Bank will transform its business model and thinking 
throughout its human resources, work processes, products and technology, 
enabling breakthrough performance and creating sustainable value for our customers and society.
