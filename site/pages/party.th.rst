After everyone has had a big Day 1 at PYCON THAILAND 2019, it will be the perfect time to relax a little and
reflect on the first day of the conference.

MiniGroovy Band will help us all wind down with their smooth saxophone tunes, the team from Bootleg Brothers
Brewing Company will make sure that there are Craft Beers (free, because it's beer) and MyBeer who will be
providing some cool, light beers to quench our thirst which we have all built up during the day.

Music, free beer, food, and of course you making new Pythonista friends - sounds like the perfect way to end Day 1
at PYCON THAILAND 2019!

"Party will take place from 6:30pm to 9:00pm on Level 6 and is included in the price of your conference ticket."
