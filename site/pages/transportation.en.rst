Suvarnabhumi airport
--------------------

To get to the venue from `Suvarnabhumi Airport`_, go down to the basement level
and get the airport link train to `Phaya Thai`_ (45 baht, terminal station).
The airport link station connects to the `Phaya Thai BTS`_ (skytrain) station.
Buy a ticket to `Wongwian Yai <(https://goo.gl/maps/mY7HWhpY71E2>`_, about 50 baht).
Take the train going to _Samrong_,  and change to the _Bang Wa_ train at
_Siam_ station.

Taxis in Bangkok
----------------

Taxis are metered, starting at 35 baht. 100-150 baht should get you anywhere in
the city center. Language and pronunciation can be an issue, so to avoid any
hassles, get the address of your destination in writing (e.g. a business card or
Google Maps).  Drivers are normally good at turning on their meters, unless
you're in a major tourist nightlife area like lower Sukhumvit or Silom at
night. Avoid parked taxis.

`Grab`_ also operates in Bangkok, and tends to be around the same price as taxis.
