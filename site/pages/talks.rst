Deep Learning in the Household
==============================



Format: Short Talk (30 minutes)

Abstract
--------

"DL is only for the big techs" might be true previously. Now, with new knowledge like Transfer Learning, open-sourced pre-trained models, and free GPUs like at Google Colab, is it now time for individual ML enthusiasts to enter and build some meaningful ML app? Let's explore together in this talk.

Bio
```

Earned a B.Eng. nearly 20 years ago, when the vocabularies like "Deep Learning" and "Data Science" had not even been materialized. His full time job is traditional software development (Python is not used) and it has no direct relevance to Machine Learning. 

He discovered MOOCs in late 2013 and completed his first MOOC on Coursera in 2014. Since then, he has completed over 60 courses (he tries to increase the number even though has already lost the exact count) including a number of Python programming and Machine Learning courses. 

In his spare time, apart from doing MOOCs/writing Python programs and practicing Keras/TensorFlow framework, he also writes Swfit programs (and published one on iOS AppStore, although, again, Swift is not used in his full time job) He also does endurance sports like long distance running (a.k.a. marathons), triathlons, and high-altitude trekking

Dr. Khamphanchai received his PhD from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA. His research interests are home/building energy management systems, Internet of things, multi-agent systems, machine learning, data analytics, demand response, cyber-physical systems, and power system operation and control. His research focus is to develop building energy management open source software (BEMOSS) for energy savings and peak demand reduction in small- and medium-sized commercial buildings. The current released version of BEMOSS is made available on the Github repository (URL: https://github.com/bemoss/bemoss_os) and on the United States Department of Energy (DOE) website (URL: http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/building-energy-management-open-source-software-development-bemoss)

Dr. Khamphanchai was a full stack Python developer focusing on developing applications for building energy management and multi-agent systems development, which is the foundation of the BEMOSS platform. He is also the active member of the IEEE Power and Energy Society, the IEEE Internet of Things Society, the IEEE Computer Society, TechShop DC/Arlington, Google Developer Group (GDG) Washington D.C., Modev Washington D.C., as well as DC robotics group. He received his Masters degrees in Electric Power System Management Field of Study from the School of Environment, Resources and Development (SERD), Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Thailand in 2011 and the B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand in 2009. 

His dissertation topic is: "An Agent-based Platform for Demand Response Implementation in Smart Buildings"

Writing a good frontend test cases using RobotFramework
=======================================================



Format: Short Talk (30 minutes)

Abstract

DIY: Python with partially charged batteries
============================================



Format: Long Talk (45 minutes)

Abstract
--------

We discuss re-implement some features of standard Python library using a subset of Python itself (e.g. range, namedtuple, property, Enum, dataclass, etc.). This allows us to gain more in-depth understanding the mechanisms inside Python as well as introducing some obscure but useful Python features.

Python + XPath = Extra Parsing Power
====================================



Format: Short Talk (30 minutes)

Abstract
--------

Python offers powerful string and nested data tools. One can parse HTML/XML with only built-ins or light wrappers. While such approaches are appealing there are benefits to borrowing more from the XML world. We discuss XPath and XML DOMs and show how well integrated approaches yield cleaner code.
