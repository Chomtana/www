Talk: Functional Programming in Python: Lessons from Haskell and Clojure

Biography
---------

I am always fascinated about programming languages. In particular, I have long
advocated for the use of functional programming over object-oriented
programming and a declarative style over an imperative one. Despite having
used Python heavily since 2013, groking Scala, Haskell and Clojure really
changed my style of writing Python code. I would like to share some of my
findings and advocate a functional style of programming in Python. My other
interests include Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methods and high-
performance computing. I am a co-founder and managing director of Arithmox, a
startup offering CTO-as-a-service and growth hacking packages to Indonesian
companies. My interest lies in the use of technology and data-driven
approaches correctly to drive growth. In a business climate where it is easy
to get sucked into the AI hype, I advocate a pragmatic and no-nonsense
approach to introducing such technologies into already-running businesses.

Talk: Demystifying Conversational AI with Python

Biography
---------

I am currently researching in the field of NLP and information retrieval as a
project assistant at IIT Delhi. I am a recent graduate, and had been conferred
with a degree of Bachelors in technology in Computer Science, in August 2018.
I got introduced to the wonders of computer science while pursuing my
undergraduate degree, and oh, boy! It was diverse. I was amazed with the
profusion of avenues that it opened for me. From natural language chatbots, to
biometrics recognition systems, path-planning robots, I found it ever-so
encouraging just to be in the game, and with a curious eye, was ready to
unearth it all. I can program in multiple languages, Python, C/C++, R, Matlab,
Chapel, GoLang, Java , Python being my first love since freshman days!.
Recently I have started programming in GoLang, and it happens to be new found
love. I am interested in the fields of NLP, ML, AI, having studied them during
my senior year, and I wish to work on enhancing healthcare with AI. More
specifically I want to work towards making technology come to the the aid of
unfortunately or differently abled people, so that they can lead healthy
lives. I am inspired by the advancing developments in making computers imitate
and understand human language, vision and intelligence and so much more, which
I feel can be used to solve challenges that the differently abled people face.
I am an avid reader, an eloquent writer, and love to share my experiences with
others as well as learn from others. I do love to talk a lot too. A cup of hot
chocolate, my laptop and a problem to code on, is what my daily routine sounds
like.
