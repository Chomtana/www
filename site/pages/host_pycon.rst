The PyCon Thailand Foundation is soliciting proposals for hosting the 2020 PyCon Thailand.



Introduction
============
This document is the call for proposals to host PyCon Thailand 2020.  This document contains some more specific
guidance on the elements of a conference proposal, conference requirements, locations, and the schedule for the
Plone Conference 2019 selection process.

Past Plone conferences have been held in Europe, North America, and South America with our 2018 conference in Asia,
but we welcome and encourage bids from anywhere in the world.

Past Conferences
For a detailed report from past Plone Conference organizers with lots of detail on logistics and organizing tips see:

Jon Stahl's "lessons learned" document from Plone Conference 2006

We will also gladly put you in contact with organizers of previous conferences.

Also it is recommended to read previous winning proposals:

Plone Conference 2013 Bras√≠lia proposal

Conference Vision and Goals
Plone conferences are the largest annual gathering of the worldwide Plone community.  They are an opportunity for the vast and diverse Plone community to forge new relationships, catch up with old friends, learn from each other, and recharge the wellsprings of creativity and innovation that power the Plone community process.

Plone conferences are also an expression of that community spirit: they are organized by a company, user group or other entity with ties to and a history with the Plone community, and are in essence not for profit events.

A great Plone conference will offer useful and engaging presentations for a wide variety of attendees. As you develop your conference proposal, please pay special attention to:

How you will attract site builders and integrators who are new to Plone.
How you will reach out to both our "traditional" user segments (nonprofits/NGOs, educational, government, intranets), as well as to emerging customers (e.g., enterprise, corporate, publishing sites).
How you will encourage presentations and plan events that are helpful and interesting for both programmers and non-programmers.
How you can strive to keep the conference costs low enough for students and self-employed consultants/designers to attend.
Required elements of a Plone Conference hosting proposal
Information about your proposed venue: capacity, rooms, multimedia facilities/support, etc.
Plan for providing reliable wireless internet access for conference attendees.
Information about logistics, accommodations, transportation, etc. in and around your proposed location.
How you plan to structure the conference and design the agenda, and how you will engage the Plone community in the process of creating the conference.
Conference marketing plan.
A complete conference budget, including all costs and revenue.
Be sure to consider and explain how you will manage cashflow; you will almost certainly need to put down money before sponsorship & registration dollars come in.
Take a look at the numbers provided by previous organizers: 2010 and 2011
About your team
Key people who will lead your effort and staff the conference. Do you have enough people to do the grunt-work before and during the conference?
Your team's history with and connection to the Plone community, including past Plone events you attended and have helped organize.
Other past event organizing experience.
Of course, we expect adherence to the Code of Conduct. Other ideas and opportunities for providing a welcoming, diversity-enhancing conference/training/sprint for attendees, speakers, trainers, trainees, partners and everyone else are especially welcome.
Estimated cost per person for the conference - keep in mind that affordability is a key issue for many Plone community members.  A good target is US$250-450/person.
Plone conference requirements
Held between mid-September and mid-November
Avoid scheduling conference events during major religious or national holidays.  For example, major feasts for various religions can move in the year and sometimes fall in October. (Dates vary each year; check a calendar of religious holidays.)
Venue must be able to accommodate 200-500 people.
Venue must have plenary room capable of accommodating all attendees, plus breakout rooms for 2-3 tracks and informal gathering space.
Reliable wireless access capable of accommodating all conference attendees simultaneously.
Appropriate audio-visual support (e.g. sound, projectors, etc.)
Venue located one hour or less from an international airport.
Easy and affordable transportation between airport, conference venue and accommodations / food / nightlife.  Conference attendees should not have to rent cars to get around.
Snacks, coffee and lunch.  (Breakfast is not a bad idea)
