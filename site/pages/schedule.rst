The more astute amongst our readers will have noticed a number of Monty Python
references. As you know (and if you don't you really should!), the name, Python
comes from the BBC show 
`Monty Python's Flying Circus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus>`_
and has nothing to do with those reptiles causing 
`formication <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formication>`_.
In honour of this, we shall have a Monty Python Quiz during the conference. A
trial quiz can be taken `here <https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9JJSMJG>`_.
