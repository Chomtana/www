Friday Warmup Event: Code War
=============================

Eight teams, onstage knockout rounds of short programming bouts, loud crowd..
mildly impressive prizes. Any language allowed, no holds barred. Think of it
like cage fighting for coders.

We guarantee this won’t be mind twisting problems for algorithm heads. It will
help to have a team with a mix of skills, a clever and/or intimidating team
name and vocal cheer squad.

For example: “Here is the complete text of *Pride and Prejudice* from this URL.
Be the first to print out the 7th and 25th sentences that contain both
’Elizabeth’ and ‘Darcy’“.

Come along to watch. Come along to compete. Come along to just hangout and meet others. Bring your laptop if you want to try the questions from the audience.

**Pizza is provided!**
