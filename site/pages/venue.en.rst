Bangkok
=======

Thailand’s capital is south-east Asia’s most enigmatic city, a head-on clash between tradition and modernity.
First-time visitors may be a little taken aback by the concrete canyons and futuristic, billboard-covered skyscrapers,
but take a few steps away from the main roads into one of the city’s countless alleys and traditional
Thai culture is everywhere – an urban cornucopia of smells, tastes, sounds and sights that one is unlikely to forget.


True Digital Park
=================

`True Digital Park <https://www.truedigitalpark.com/>`_. is Thailand’s first and Southeast
Asia’s largest startup and tech entrepreneurs campus. Spanning over 200,000 sq.m, the
emerging innovation district “Bangkok CyberTech”, giving vast expansion opportunities
across digital domains and geographic spaces.

`True Digital Park <https://www.truedigitalpark.com/>`_. is a critical driver to the
development of the startup and innovation ecosystem in Thailand all under one roof with
startups, entrepreneurs, tech companies investors, accelerators, incubators, academies
and government agencies. It features a wide range of world-class business and

Transportation
==============

.. image:: /venue/5.jpg


Train/BTS
---------
By the far the easiest way to to TDPK is via BTS. Exit Punnawithi Station by continuing on the
skywalk (near exit 3/4) for 5 minutes and you will see the venue on your left.

You can use cash or buy a travel card, see
`Getting around Bangkok <http://www.bangkok.com/information-travel-around/bts.htm>`_
for details.

Google maps works well for public transport directions.

Taxis in Bangkok
----------------

Taxis are metered, starting at 35 baht. 100-150 baht should get you anywhere in
the city center. Language and pronunciation can be an issue, so to avoid any
hassles, get the address of your destination in writing (e.g. a business card or
Google Maps).  Drivers are normally good at turning on their meters, unless
you're in a major tourist nightlife area like lower Sukhumvit or Silom at
night. Avoid parked taxis.

On many corners are moto-cy or motocylcle taxis wearing orange vests. For between
15-80baht they will take you the extra 1-2km you need to go after you get off a BTS,
often avoiding traffic jams. Ask the price before you get on and hold on tight
(to the bar behind you, not the driver).

Grab (uber)
-----------

`Grab`_ also operates in Bangkok, and tends to be a bit more than taxis but often will follow
GPS so can be easier to explan where to go.

They also operate motobikes which will get you there faster by avoiding traffic jams at an
increased chance of personal injury.

Suvarnabhumi airport
--------------------

To get to the venue from `Suvarnabhumi Airport`_, go down to the basement level
and get the airport link train to `Phaya Thai`_ (45 baht, terminal station).
The airport link station connects to the `Phaya Thai BTS`_ (skytrain) station.

.. _Phaya Thai BTS: https://goo.gl/maps/V67Yk9AU26x
.. _Phaya Thai: https://goo.gl/maps/oZyJYfeV87v

The whole journey takes about 90 minutes. Trains stop running at midnight.

You can use cash or buy a travel card, see
`Getting around Bangkok <http://www.bangkok.com/information-travel-around/bts.htm>`_
for details.

An airport taxi from airport shouldn't cost more than around 300 baht including
airport surcharge and tolls, and take around an hour, depending on traffic.

Don Mueang airport
------------------

If you're taking a domestic or regional flight, you may be coming from `Don Mueang`_ airport.
There isn't a train from there (yet), though you can take bus A1 to connect to the BTS at `Mo Chit`_.
A taxi to the venue should take around 40 minutes.

Connectivity
============

Most restaurants, cafés and bars in Bangkok have free WiFi.
As long as your phone is not provider-locked, it is also possible to get a
tourist SIM. (You have to register with passport.) The easiest is to get it at
the airport, all the major providers have kiosks at Arrivals.
See the `Prepaid Data SIM Card Wiki <http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Thailand>`_ for all the details.

Note that the venue has `TrueWifi hotspots
<http://www.truewifi.net/wifi/findhotspot>`_, so if you're getting a SIM card,
then True is a good option.

Safety and security
===================

The most dangerous thing in Bangkok is probably the traffic. Stay calm and
polite, and you really shouldn't have any problems. Outside of tourist areas,
you might have trouble making yourself understood, so it's a good idea to carry
a business card or map of your accommodation to show a taxi driver if you need
it.  Some super-crowded places like `Jatujak Weekend Market
<https://www.chatuchakmarket.org/>`_ may have pickpockets operating. It's
always a good idea to have a copy of your important documents, like passport
and tickets.

The `tourist police <https://touristpolice.go.th/en/>`_ can speak at least
Thai, English and Chinese. They are reachable by phone at 1155, on
`Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/1155TPB/>`_, or via their website.
