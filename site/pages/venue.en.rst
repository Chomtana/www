Bangkok
=======

Thailand’s capital is south-east Asia’s most enigmatic city, a head-on clash between tradition and modernity.
First-time visitors may be a little taken aback by the concrete canyons and futuristic, billboard-covered skyscrapers,
but take a few steps away from the main roads into one of the city’s countless alleys and traditional
Thai culture is everywhere – an urban cornucopia of smells, tastes, sounds and sights that one is unlikely to forget.

If you'd like to book a tour while you're here, **go beyond asia** has a

.. _Phaya Thai BTS: https://goo.gl/maps/V67Yk9AU26x
.. _Phaya Thai: https://goo.gl/maps/oZyJYfeV87v

You can use cash or buy a travel card, see 
`Getting around Bangkok <http://www.bangkok.com/information-travel-around/bts.htm>`_

==================

Taxis in Bangkok
----------------

Taxis are metered, starting at 35 baht. 100-150 baht should get you anywhere in
the city center. Language and pronunciation can be an issue, so to avoid any
hassles, get the address of your destination in writing (e.g. a business card or
Google Maps).  Drivers are normally good at turning on their meters, unless
you're in a major tourist nightlife area like lower Sukhumvit or Silom at
night. Avoid parked taxis.

`Grab`_ also operates in Bangkok, and tends to be around the same price as taxis.

Connectivity
------------

Most restaurants, cafés and bars in Bangkok have free WiFi.
As long as your phone is not provider-locked, it is also possible to get a
tourist SIM. (You have to register with passport.) The easiest is to get it at
the airport, all the major providers have kiosks at Arrivals.
See the `Prepaid Data SIM Card Wiki <http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Thailand>`_ for all the details.

Safety and security
-------------------

The most dangerous thing in Bangkok is probably the traffic. Stay calm and
polite, and you really shouldn't have any problems. Outside of tourist areas,
you might have trouble making yourself understood, so it's a good idea to carry
a business card or map of your accommodation to show a taxi driver if you need
it.  Some super-crowded places like `Jatujak Weekend Market
<https://www.chatuchakmarket.org/>`_ may have pickpockets operating. It's
always a good idea to have a copy of your important documents, like passport
and tickets. 

The `tourist police <https://touristpolice.go.th/en/>`_ can speak at least
Thai, English and Chinese. They are reachable by phone at 1155, on 
`Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/1155TPB/>`_, or via their website.
