Venue
=====

Thailand’s capital is south-east Asia’s most enigmatic city, a head-on clash between tradition and modernity.
First-time visitors may be a little taken aback by the concrete canyons and futuristic, billboard-covered skyscrapers,
but take a few steps away from the main roads into one of the city’s countless alleys and traditional
Thai culture is everywhere – an urban cornucopia of smells, tastes, sounds and sights that one is unlikely to forget.
