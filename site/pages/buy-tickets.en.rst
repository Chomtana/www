The PyCon Thailand Team and the Thai Programming Association are pleased to announce that `tickets are available for purchase on Ticket Melon <https://www.ticketmelon.com/thaiprogrammer/pycon2019/>`_.

Buy your ticket soon! Early bird tickets are limited!

If you can afford it, we encourage you to purchase a regular ticket as it enables others to attend who can't afford a regular ticket. You'll be helping us build a Python community event that is accessible to more people.

If your company is paying for you, you can only get a tax invoice with the regular ticket.

Purchase tickets via `Ticket Melon <https://www.ticketmelon.com/thaiprogrammer/pycon2019/>`_.
