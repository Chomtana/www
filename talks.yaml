    <p>I am currently researching in the field of NLP and information retrieval as a project assistant at IIT Delhi. I am a recent graduate, and had been conferred with a degree of Bachelors in technology in Computer Science, in August 2018.
    I got introduced to the wonders of computer science while pursuing my undergraduate degree, and oh, boy! It was diverse. I was amazed with the profusion of avenues that it opened for me. From natural language chatbots, to  biometrics recognition systems, path-planning robots, I found it ever-so encouraging just to be in the game, and with a curious eye, was ready to unearth it all.
    I can program in multiple languages, Python, C/C++, R, Matlab, Chapel, GoLang, Java , Python being my first love since freshman days!.  Recently I have started programming in GoLang, and it happens to be new found love. I am interested in the fields of NLP, ML, AI, having studied them during my senior year, and I wish to work on  enhancing healthcare with AI. More specifically  I want to work towards making technology come to the the aid of unfortunately or differently abled people, so that they can lead healthy lives. I am inspired by the advancing developments in making computers imitate and understand human language, vision and intelligence and so much more, which I feel can be used to solve challenges that the differently abled people face.
    I am an avid reader, an eloquent writer, and love to share my experiences with others as well as learn from others. I do love to talk a lot too. A cup of hot chocolate, my laptop and a problem to code on, is what my daily routine sounds like.</p>

    <p>I am always fascinated about programming languages. In particular, I have long advocated for the use of functional
    programming over object-oriented programming and a declarative style over an imperative one. Despite having used
    Python heavily since 2013, groking Scala, Haskell and Clojure really changed my style of writing Python code.
    I would like to share some of my findings and advocate a functional style of programming in Python. My other
    interests include Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methods and high-performance computing.</p>
    <p>I am a co-founder and managing director of Arithmox, a startup offering CTO-as-a-service and growth hacking
    packages to Indonesian companies. My interest lies in the use of technology and data-driven approaches correctly
    to drive growth. In a business climate where it is easy to get sucked into the AI hype, I advocate a pragmatic
    and no-nonsense approach to introducing such technologies into already-running businesses.</p>

    <p>I established my company called moegi Co., Ltd. to start the drone business.
    I am an engineer of the front-end system, but recently I have been focued on RaspberryPi and Arduino, and have been actively transmitting mechanisms in which objects move in reality by using Python language.
    This year, I participated in "PyCon 2018 Cleveland" and I felt the momentum of overseas forces.
    I exchanged contact information with Pythonista who are active overseas so that I can cooperate with them.
    Additionary, as a staff member of Pyladies Tokyo, I did a community activity spreading Python, and did Python Boot Camp which helps Python beginners and spreads Python as Saitama and Fukushima local staff. Python Boot Camp in Fukushima, activities such as preparing the venue as well as taking up local newspapers were underway.
    In addition, I am participating in the Python related community and am doing activities to improve self-study and day-to-day technology.</p>
